    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). He is best known for his equation E = mc², which states that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared.

    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>
      Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. He showed an early interest in mathematics and physics, and by the age of 12, he was already studying advanced mathematics on his own. In 1905, he published four groundbreaking papers in the scientific journal Annalen der Physik, which laid the foundation for modern physics.

    <h2>Contributions to Science</h2>
    <p>
      Einstein made numerous significant contributions to the field of physics, including the theory of general relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of gravity. He also made important contributions to the development of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.

    <h2>Later Life and Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      In 1933, Einstein left Germany due to the rise of the Nazi Party and settled in the United States. He became a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he continued his research until his retirement. Einstein's theories have had a profound impact on our understanding of the physical world and have paved the way for many technological advancements.
